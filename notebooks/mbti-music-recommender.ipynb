primarily  natural selection for         years if i remember      my strange view is if   phenotypes appear outwardly equal because social equality has been pushed to far  but   is a stronger genotype  how then does a potential mate naturally select the stronger      is society interfering with human evolution by way of political correctness   i e in the quest for equality just one point of contention   is society making strong phenotypes weaker due to the      this seems a very similar to the psychological definition of maturity  having the ability to respond to your environment in an appropriate manner  this is a good description of maturity  but to me      the way you split these   types is with their interactions with other people although house seems outwardly introverted  his need for interaction with people is ever apparent  and his thought process      thinking entp is most introverted of the extroverts   thought of    reasons why fictional character house is entp   his knowlage is extensive on all subjects and his mind is sharp as razor         thinking should come up with   step plan to refine this idea so i could more easliy develop this make a million idea  but the   step plan for refining the make a million idea would also require a        thinking has come up with cunning plan to gets millions of pounds and then burn it in front of many entjs with my father at front of the pack of them   step one  post thread in entp forum best way      thinking house   entp unhealthy one maybe though    i was opposite i was always told to voice my views and opinions  where my parent s fell flat was in fact entj dad estp mum   no emotions present lol  was fun and intresting childhood with my   exxx      lol great list  i have one of these good behavior lists in social situations to is called my isfj girlfriend  she keeps an invisible mental list of all things iv ever said that anger people and      im pretty sure saudi arabia areas of nigeria and other assorted countries have a natural treatment to solve this     go in to a shop an steal somthing  an naturally problem solved when they cut ur      hmm what would happen if i threw an istp into a super massive black hole      would black hole win  or would istp suck life out of the black hole       lol dont need to be entj to plot someones destruction  entps are naturally better at this because my way atleast they would never see it coming would hit them with the enormity of a super massive      another entp  i wish i knew one irl lol it seems like im surrounded by sjs in my life lol  although im pretty damn sure my    year old daughter is entp    i have a cat and its messed up lol  its the most anally retentive cat iv ever seen  i e it will use litter tray and spend    mins scratching at litter then meow at me next time want wee to change      maturity is important in all types   we just dont seem as condescending as intps in debates but we argee more as we will argue any issue even if we dont belive in it where intps normally only argue      i always thought one of those sphynx cats would be more sinister looking evil villian pets  or you could just shave a fluffy one cus tbh who does not like a shaved pussy lol     outwardly we do not apper as him being subordinate though  if it was not for our name tags u would think he was in charge and i was subordinate  because i let him take lead most times as i recognise      in personal life i would not spend massive amount of time with entj  but there intrinsic value in society is a logical inevitability  and being entp i share their limited capacity for emotions and      i ve always worked well with entps   i think it helps that i enjoy their company    i like their sense of humor and their energy  we think differently  so we bring different things to the table  but      question is do you think entp entj workplace combination is one of most beneficial combinations of nts    tbh only thing that stops people from thinking entj is my manager is the name badges lol  mine saying store manager and his being deputy   but under the appearance of this im the evil dictator in      what other types think of entjs is really irrelevant  as what a entj brings to the table is intrinsically valuable and they never seem to become a liability   where as entps value can be above and      this reminds me a friend of mine is an entp and seems to have a mostly negative view of entj s  like she gets paranoid about certain people being manipulative  controlling etc  and then will be      i must confess that i baited my isfj gf in to an argument debate this evening because i was bored   i also spent an hour today mocking my istp brother in law as the black hole he is was in danger      lol this might be intresting    hmmm   intp   entp    days of amazing conversations   billion unique ways of creating a utopian society and how to implement it   then entps get very hungry consider hunter gathering as option  to      intolerant  insufferable  overbearing  overly vocal  power mad  stubborn  impatient and arrogant  thought id list your good qualitys lol   but entjs are like mouths everyone should have one        forgive myself  my logic was sound i was suffering depression and wanted some pills  i proceeded to make a list of all the symptoms i had from dsm and typed it all out in logical rational way  with      okay    i wasn t directing my post to you but gee  thanks for insults   this thread isn t only about estps but i m sure you will carry on any way  you seem mighty hyper and

am a weirdo i guess   sometimes i just forget people that tend to play with our      ive often helped many people asking nothing in return and find myself in surrogate positions                  but idk i think i am just not good enough for people    reflective upon it  yes i tend to be an estj when talking but it is more of a defense mechanism i do  i dont know why  maybe its because i sometimes just tend to not know what to say so things go out      i shall call her tonight  i think that because of my past heartbreaks and stuff  i think about it too much before entailing a random person  but i think that not knowing this person gives me some      yes  the endless what ifs  it feels kind of relieving actually to do something about it  the randomness is what i cant get over lol  i guess i should call her to get to know her a bit  be it as i      ha yes  i think i will just go for it  i am over thinking this  p   lately  ive had a bad streak with friendships because of misunderstandings and such  yet i always regain or gain new friends and have unforgettable times with them  like many of you  sometimes i over      i always have difficulties  but using a bit of humor can help a lot to break the tension  i followed the format the teacher gave us for speaking  just imagine yourself reading outloud expressively      i think sometimes people dont see us as they imagine but sometimes we are everything they imagined but since we kind of never got it  it never developed  but tthe rejection of a person sometimes is      really sad while the world is happy    i am tired of being a puppet and puppet master  i think most of my complications of everything is about trust and solidarity  i was always left alone and have always clamored for independence  while      aww this made me feel like       y   iugwigvjpwqeg  q inside  ive been in both spectrums and ugh          i always seem to lose    quite common for me    i do  but then again i sometimes go back to the source    dri live

some time you will remember even the      that was me in school too  everyone got saddened and i wanted to leave early  i always flat line emotionally  but then explode with feelings at times    it is horrible  but both have their      everyday is the same nightmare  since i wake up  my mind is not with me as before  it is a distant cloud yearning for love and acceptance and i feel so incomplete         yet i can recognize that my      we draw attention whenever we go somewhere  people always stare at me  i stare back  then i win and they dont stare back lol    yeah  i had been shut for some time until someone made me think otherwise and now i remember why i used to be like that  back to my intp self again       why do i make my life more miserable by thinking about the past  do you long your troubled past  then why do you think of it  nunca amaste a ciertas personas  y aun asi  no te las puedes quitar de la      hopefully you and him talk about it soon  let him know what you think and how you came up with the thought and how important this is for you  and for him    rigt now i can say i am depressed basically because i lost hopes for some love i had longed  and apathy has only increased since    but then again       por que no puedo  ni una cancion cantarle  a el deseo de mi vida  its been   months since i last saw her and spoke to her            i feel like a mummy  not even in facebook      when i want to talk  i usually slow down what i have to say because i try to speak so fast that it sounds like gibberish    a lot if this has happened to me in exact ways   before  i remember feeling guilty about it because i knew i could have saved someone  but then again i only thought they were dreams that coincided      i remember when my friend would show up at my house after i told him  hey ive got some bud  dont bring anyone eh  and after i let him in  he just whistled and a whole crew of people that had      sometimes emotions can have biased consequences  and people can take advantage of a person who bases actions on emotions and feelings  detaching from emotion in some cases makes me see things how      mostly its about not thinking bad about the self

of people i see as underdogs minority vulnerable  i hate seeing parents treat their children with unnecessary harshness  and i m also a bit jealous of my good friends and siblings        if it has to do with conflict or  possibly  hurting someone s feelings i tend to resort to a watered down version of my feelings   or not at all  it just depends  otherwise i m pretty expressive to      yeah

that in what i wear  i was very insecure in college and went over the top to stand out as an artist  cringe  but i still      i think i was quite sweet as a kid  but dreamy might be a bit much  i had

i was coming up with a list of friends and family to send letters out to  i had spent the morning by myself reading and thinking       these are great ideas    some things that have helped me   distancing myself from my emotion  for example  i have feelings of despair sadness worthlessness i need to deal with  rather than i am       infpanonymous ha no reason  just  i m not into that stuff    shrugs    i think some people  sort of  avoid me  yes  or at least they don t actively try to come into much contact with me  i ve realized that some people just aren t as comfortable around quiet  and      i feel bad   i ve tried to get several of my friends into it       perhaps they feel the same way     hm  people who assume because i am soft spoken and reserved that i am naive and childlike  craving meaningful deep conversations and having few people to have these conversations with  i m out with      at age    i realized that i was nearly grown up and that my life was essentially meaningless  like i was terribly depressed  and that was frightening and painful because i couldn t verbalize it to      thank you for seeing me    you were the first boy i fell in love with  i was that silly shy younger kid who sort of stalked you  and although i think you knew it  you never led me on  rejected me      i like scents that remind me of being a little kid  like dandelions and

reached safety  but as for what happened      well now my avatar is a doctor who clockwork creature  i always liked this monster because it is just a worker trying to do it s job  kind of       st   thanks for your reply  i appreciate all the help i can get   nd   i think everyone has the right to their opinion     however too many people abuse that right  p     yea  not doing the iron man thing xd  thanks for all the advice everyone      thanks     i think i needed some humour  i might show them this  maybe     i know they won t do anything harsh like throw me out or beat me   although i have places to go     but i really don t      i don t really know how to judge personality types  i can only say mums introverted  while dad is extroverted  p   ok  so i understand what i want  and how i feel about liking men  that s all good  but the problem now is how do i tell my parents   i want to tell them  but i really don t know how to say to them      i m contempt  as always i suppose  i have spent this afternoon buried in my book and in my own world  only after spending this morning out with our animals  suppose it s a good mix      i will have      whats the hardest thing i m going to face in life      i haven t got a clue  but from my current perspective  telling my parents i m gay seems like a huge hurdle  i do suspect that it will seem      i do  mi  too  and torchwood      oh that s fictional  oh well  still      i just got the book two days ago and have just read it  i thought it was brilliant    this is true for me too  my family love me  and i them  but they never wanted to deeply understand who i am  i am contempt with this and just keeping the deeper me to my self  different people see      to look at  and understand yourself  knowing yourself is important  and there is so much to know   also be happy   i have not let anything get me down lately  and i feel better for it  either that      i guess not  but i wasn t watching comedy central     this is such an incredible song      thanks for your reply  and i can relate  in part at least  to you    this is not as big a deal as i may have made it to be  but the reply to pointing it out well just do it more or something along those lines    i feel the same  although i have only ever  entered  this state of mind in a time of  need  or  emotion  not just for the sake of it  sometimes i think i m too young  other times i just live my life      i find that my parents are never happy with any effort i give them with anything  i will say i used to be quite lazy but lately i have tried to do by best and do everything they ask without hassle      hey there          those spoiler buttons still pre load the images so it doesn t matter   i m not the best driver  and i currently hold only a restricted licence  but i drive as safely as i can  and  don t tell my parents  only speed on an open road with no one around    don t let someone tell you your beliefs are wrong  they are yours  what you think is right and true  people may not agree with you  that does not make your beliefs wrong it just means they are      midnight blue  no question   i can be so many things and i feel i m very contrasting   you may see a dark shade of blue where  in fact  there is a story behind every line of that magnificent      i m fine with ads  i make websites so know how sometimes you need them  just a reccomendation though  make them open in a new window when clicked   target  top     yes i want people to understand  some people anyway  but i think it doesn t matter if they could understand me  because so many people don t care to  not really and fully    just interested to know what some other infjs  ideas are on letting people in to our lives  or keeping a distance  personaly there are very few people i let in to my world at all  and i let no one      i wouldn t be bothered personally  actually i sometimes actually think that i don t realize how obvious i can be or how others might feel    if i don t see good in someone  i won t hang around  if it happens to be you chances are you won t notice me by accident  i can be good at just disappearing if i don t want to see you   in a library or out on a walk somewhere remote alone   i agree  and although i m a very black and white person  on the outside anyway   this website needs some colour  it is too bright and the black doesn t help at all    i m defiantly a night person  no doubt about it  i enjoy being out late and sleeping half the day away    when you say you have lost your balance i knew exactly how you feel  i can say i m in a similar place right now and have lost the thing that really keeps me going  my balance  and my world i spinning      looks good  i think the top navigation bar news would look better with a darker colour  white seems to bright    i would be with the tenth  all the way       actually both of them      and capt  jack   i was going to say that  about doctor who   but i thought my second thing seemed more appropriate      but apart from the tardis  i would get in my car and just drive  stopping only to enjoy a      thanks  solitude     your right and i do like constructive criticism because you have something to work on and improve  i guess it just upset me a little    how do you feel when people criticize your work or something you do   whenever someone tells me that something i have done is not good enough it makes me feel like i am not good enough    maybe      yes    owner of a lonely heart    a doctor who fan i have to say repeated memory wipes by the silence will eventually fry your brain   the eleventh doctor but i m the same  and when i do remember it s after a while and people      currently i am reading  the white wolf s son   a good read  not quite what i expected when i picked it up but i will finish it soon  and next i want to read  the wolf gift       tonight i sit outside my window in the blackness of night  staring out into the wilderness we call space  peace  beauty  i could stay here till the morning light  the thousands of suns i stare upon      i was going to close my facebook a few months back  but as well as wanting to be able to message my family in ausse and school friends i found that i had connected a few other websites to it         seconds to mars   all of my collections  it seems to be fitting my mood right now    i have seen it  and i agree  i did actually think that the first time i watched the movie  and from the beginning  or when they got their powers  i kinda thought andrew would never work right with      ok so i have just watched underworld    awakening  and must say it was a really good film  compared to the other films out in the last few months anyway  i don t think it was as good as the first        i would never want to turn off my emotions  sometimes i hide them from the world  but i still need them for me  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
